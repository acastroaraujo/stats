The two groups might be different from each other whether they get treated or not.\n\n-   **Treatment effect heterogeneity.** The two groups might respond differently to the treatment.\n\n    This is important because researchers sometimes assume a **constant effect** for every unit in the population. This is implied in the unit homogeneity assumption. But if the variability of causal effects is large across the population, then the ATE might not represent the causal effect of a specific unit very well; the ATE might be irrelevant, no matter how carefully we estimate it.\n\nThree types of treatment effects:\n\n-   $\\text{ATE}$, for all units (effect of switching)\n\n-   $\\text{ATT}$, for treated units (effect of taking away treatment)\n\n-   $\\text{ATC}$ or $\\text{ATU}$, for untreated units (effect of adding treatment)\n\n<aside>Some times we see these terms pre-fixed with an $S$ (for sample) or a $P$ (for population).</aside>\n\n@tbl-pot-example allows us to gain further intuition on these calculations with a hypothetical example in which people are assigned college degrees randomly.\n\n| Group ($T$)              | $E[Y^1]$ | $E[Y^0]$ |\n|--------------------------|----------|----------|\n| College Degree ($T = 1$) | **1000** | 600^\\*^  |\n| No Degree ($T = 0$)      | 800^\\*^  | **500**  |\n\n: Potential Outcomes Example {#tbl-pot-example}\n\n<aside>\n\n<br>\n\nSimple experiments of these kind are obviously impossible in the social sciences.\n\n\\* means unobservable\n\n</aside>\n\nIf **30%** of the population has a degree...\n\n::: grid\n::: g-col-6\n-   What is the naive estimate?\n\n    [500]{style=\"color: #C5C5C5;\"}\n\n-   What is the ATT?\n\n    [400]{style=\"color: #C5C5C5;\"}\n:::\n\n::: g-col-6\n-   What is the ATC?\n\n    [300]{style=\"color: #C5C5C5;\"}\n\n-   What is the ATE?\n\n    [$0.3\\times 400 + 0.7 \\times 300 = 330$]{style=\"color: #C5C5C5;\"}\n:::\n:::\n\n**More than two treatment levels, continuous treatments, and multiple treatment factors**\n\nMultiple treatment effects can be defined relative to a baseline level, following the general principles of regression modeling with indicator (or dummy) variables.\n\nTreatment levels can be continuous.\n\n> To conceptualize randomization with a continuous treatment, think of spinning a spinner that can land on any of the potential levels of the treatment assignment. As with regression inputs in general, it can make sense to fit more complicated models as suggested by theory or supported by data. A linear model---which estimates the average effect on $y$ for each additional unit of $z$---is a natural starting point for effects that are believed to be monotonically increasing or decreasing functions of the treatment level.\n>\n> @gelman2020 [pp. 342]\n\nFinally, we can also consider multiple simultaneous treatments.\n\n> ...multiple treatments can be administered in combination. For instance, depressed individuals could be randomly assigned to receive nothing, drugs, counseling sessions, or both drugs and counseling sessions. These combinations could be modeled as two treatments and their interaction or as four distinct treatments.\n>\n> @gelman2020 [pp. 342]\n\n**Using design and analysis to address imbalance and lack of overlap between treatment and control groups**\n\nRegression can be useful even in the context of randomized experiments.\n\n> In practice, we can never ensure that treatment and control groups are balanced on all relevant pre-treatment characteristics. However, there are statistical approaches that may bring us closer. At the design stage, we can use *randomization* to ensure that treatment and control groups are balanced in expectation, and we can use *blocking* to reduce the variation in any imbalance. At the analysis stage, we can *adjust* for pre-treatment variables to correct for differences between the two groups to reduce bias in our estimate of the sample average treatment effect. We can further adjust for differences between sample and population if our goal is to estimate the population average treatment effect.\n>\n> @gelman2020 [pp. 344]\n\nWe can increase the precision of treatment effect estimates by adjusting for pre-treatment variables that are predictive of the outcome---i.e., we get lower standard errors on the treatment parameter.\n\n**Group or cluster-randomized experiments**\n\nSometimes it's difficult to randomize treatment assignments to individual units, and so we might randomize groups or clusters to receive the treatment instead.\n\n> A decision to assign treatments at the group level can be driven by cost or logistical concerns. It might be more cost effective to provide free flu shots to a random subset of health clinics, for example, than to have professionals go to every clinic and then randomly assign individuals to receive shots. Assignment at the clinic level would also avoid creating ill will among potential study participants being deprived of a service that others in the same location are able to receive. Cluster-randomized experiments are also used to avoid spillover or contagion effects (which can also be considered as violations of the stable unit treatment value assumption or SUTVA).\n>\n> @gelman2020 [pp. 349-50]\n\n## SUTVA\n\nBesides **ignorability** (see @eq-ignore), randomization implies certain other properties which we might consider to be **assumptions**.\n\nThe most important one is the **stable unit treatment value assumption** (SUTVA). It means that we assume that there is no interference among units (i.e., no spillovers) and no hidden versions of the treatment.\n\nThus, one can imagine person $i$'s outcome to be \"a function not only of her own treatment assignment, but also the treatment assignments of others in the sample\" [@gelman2020, pp. 353]. These becomes intractable very quickly. For example, in a sample of just 10 people and a binary treatment, we would have 2^10^ = 1024 potential outcomes for each person. Thus, researchers often hope that there is no interference among units, or else they think about modeling spillover in some way.\n\nSUTVA also implies that there are no hidden versions of treatments---i.e., we want $t_i$ to equal $t_j$.\n\n> Examples of potential SUTVA violations abound. An experiment testing the effect of a new fertilizer by randomly assigning adjacent plots to treatment or control is a classic example. Fertilizer from one plot might leach into an adjacent plot assigned to receive no fertilizer and thus affect the yield in that control plot. Vaccines that reduce the probability of a contagious disease within a school, business, or community could easily lead to violation of SUTVA if the vaccine is actually effective. Consider an experiment that recruited families from the same public housing complex and randomized them to receive a voucher to move to a better neighborhood or not. This could suffer from interference if a given family moving might influence (positively or negatively) the well-being of another family that happened to be randomized to not receive the voucher.\n>\n> @gelman2020 [pp. 353]\n\nIn educational settings, potential SUTVA violations are often a reason to assign treatments at the classroom or school level.\n\n## Extra\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\ntheme_set(\n  theme_light(base_family = \"Avenir Next Condensed\") +\n  theme(strip.background = element_rect(fill = \"#666666\"))\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Average Treatment Effects\n\n> 18.4 The table below describes a hypothetical experiment on 8 people.
